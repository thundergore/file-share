### Backstory
[[Orietta Doria-Colonna]], 11th Princess of Melfi is daughter of [[Oberto Colonna]] - prominent steel merchant and widower to [[Maria Francesca Colonna]] and step daughter to [[Anna Maria Doria]] last remaining daughter of the [[House of Doria]].

Orietta has 3 younger blood sisters, [[Maria Colonna]], [[Teresa Colonna ]]and[[ Francesca Colonna]] named mostly in honour of their deceased mother. These triplets were born under an ill omen and are stunted, strange.. cursed...

Her father, Oberto, lost his beloved wife in childbirth (the triplets) and struggled to find a place for them in his heart and home. He sent them to foster care when Orietta was a young girl. 

This fostering took place in a neighbouring province. There the young girls did not thrive, they were not cared for.  

As the amount of trouble they caused spread their local legend, they attracted the wrong sort of attention and fell into the company and as rumour had it, worse, of a fallen entertainer (now peddlar of tricks for coins) [[Bartolomeo]]. 

Upon hearing of the triplets historical and privileged relations, and on the run from the local authorities for a spate of grave robberies that were DEFINITELY NOT him he swears, Bartolomeo helped them abscond from the foster care they were placed with and together with his  two large hounds [[Ignazio and Stefano]] the group returned to Oberto Colonna's home town.

In the years since their absence Oberto's mercantile star had risen. War - ever a great source of profit - had driven the demand for his steel through the roof. His money made him impossible for other rich, noble families to ignore.

Orietta showed great potential too, she was smart, beautiful, graceful, quick to learn. She showed a capacity to excel in whatever she chose. She had a combative streak and nothing exemplified this more than her torturing of the local sons of simple folk. These young lads, strong but dumb often met a stick or other improvised weapon that pushed the odds firmly in Orietta's favour should they try their luck with her.

Her father was never one to stifle his only remaining daughter. And so it was that he beamed with pride as she was granted apprenticeship under famed fencer & sword smith [[Marcantonio Aria]]. 

The noble House of Doria were able to propose the best match and Oberto married Anna Maria in a star-studded affair. 

Orietta had all the trappings and potential of a new scion of this joint house.  Her step sisters - the daughters of Anna Maria Doria and her former husband[[ Andrea III Doria]] were beautiful yet had no other graces. The best their mother hoped for was a suitable suitor and a good match. 

Jealousy for Orietta's other qualities brewed within the [[Doria sisters]], even as they felt contempt for the non-feminine activities Orietta was drawn towards.


After numerous championships - where not even the local lords and sons of lords could best her blade - Orietta had a formal meeting with her stepmother and other step relations amongst the powerful members of the Doria family. 

They told her they were so very proud but focus must be put on finding a good match for Orietta. The strapping twins of the slightly less noble, but richer, Pamphili family, [[Giorgio and Giuseppe Pamphili]]  were firm favourites.

Orietta, long allowed to follow her own choices by her doting father, was furious that her potential was being directed by others and went to Oberto to complain.

Oberto, unsure of how to navigate the political cuthroat world of nobility encouraged that she play along for now and wrote to Marcantonio to explain his daughter no longer had need of his apprenticeship. She had "grown up".

Orietta took from this advice that she should learn to be as single-minded and ruthless as her step-family...

That night Orietta had strange dreams, paralyzing night terrors and awoke in a daze with a bite just above her collarbone. She thought it the work of some strange insect and shook the extreme sleep haze from her body.

She put a plan in motion, went to Marcantonio and explained, he laughed at the idea of one so gifted being limited by the meek. He felt the same and it was one of the reasons he accepted her apprenticeship. He had grown fond of her (having lost a child together with his wife at a young age in a bandit attack) and vowed to teach her until such time as SHE told him she had no need of him. 

He presented her with a blade made for when she completed her apprenticeship, his best work. He called it the [[Aria Blade]] and it was weighted just for her.

Marcantonio had numerous other apprentices in other noble houses and the word spread through them back to the Doria family. 

They were outraged and, having history with Marcantonio, ready to take extreme measures to put their new scion in place. It was only a short time between the presentation of the Aria Blade to Orietta and the discovery of Marcantonio dead of a sword wound but drained of blood in an alley in the pleasure district. 

The local paper presented this as a tragic but expected outcome of visiting a less than savoury area for less than savoury antics. Orietta knew though that no one in the town had one ounce of the capacity required to best Marcantonio. 

She suspected something else and tried to coerce the law enforcement to take this seriously. 

They were suspiciously incensed by her suggestion and told her "keep in line with your family". 

This drove Orietta to confront her step family, where they rather smugly demured to knowing anything but recommended she leave the constabulary be.

Feeling trapped Orietta went to her father who was unusually short with her (having just that day crossed paths with Bartolomeo and the triplets) who told her, for the first time in his life "do as you are told". 

Orietta fled the mansion to her childhood neighbourhood where she also met Bartolomeo and her sisters. After a rather happy reunion (the 4 sisters had always gotten on at a young age, the triplets sharing a great many of the traits of Orietta herself) Orietta explained her current woes. 

The triplets could not understand such a life, living as they had "free" in their exile (which is what they had in effect been subjected to). Bartolomeo was a wily bastard and saw a chance to call in old favours and try his hand at a new series of tricks he'd been working on... 

He proposed a macabre plan, something a normal human would be repulsed by - if they believed it. Orietta, however, whether in her frustration and anguish, or something else, something more sinister, very much enjoyed the sound of this plan.

Orietta, Bartolomeo and the triplets raided the family mausoleum of the Doria family. Bartolomeo raised the dead of that noble house, rooting up the family tree: the rotten husks of [[Andrea III, Andre, Laura, Pomodoro, Henri and Olimpia Doria]] shambled back to the bands hideout (an abandoned bakery Bartolomeo knew of). 

Each of the dead raised had a connection with the Doria step sisters. Over the course of the next few weeks, the warband (now declaring themselves at war with the Doria family) used these Zombies to terrify the sisters. They would appear in the dark as their coach road around town. They would stand outside their window and groan in old, half rembered voices. They'd vanish as the guards were sent after them. 

Orietta, an inside agent, would act as a changed woman, comforting her step sisters. 

At this point Orietta began to become extremely uncomfortable holding silverware. She lost her appetite. Appeared pale. She'd find herself in a daze during the day. At night her senses were ablaze and she'd run, almost inhumanly fast, to her warband to cackle over the step-sisters fears and plan new zombie surprises.

At this point Bartolomeo said he had a surprise for her. He took her to an improvised cell in the basement where Ignazio and Stefano slept and showed her. 

On the floor, naked, surrounded by the large hounds and the still, rotten, upright corpses of their former nearest and dearest, the Doria sisters screamed and writhed in mental anguish, not able to truly process what was happening. As they caught sight of Orietta, their minds broke. That she could be responsible for something so wrong was too much. 

Orietta should have felt something at this point: two human beings she had lived with and known for years, competitors but all the same, in such a situation this should have aroused something.

But there was nothing.

At this moment, Orietta knew something had changed within her. She immediately suspected Bartolomeo and lifted him bodily to the wall almost crushing him.

He convinced her that he knew nothing of the source, the cause, but that he knew since first meeting her she was a vampire... a fledgling but still a soul on the road to the darkness never to return.

Here, our campaign can begin.
